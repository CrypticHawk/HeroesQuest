	<p>You call for backup, you know you need assistance if you want this to go well.<br>
	A team to help you will make this smoother.<br>
	Your back up says they will be there by the sunrise.<br>
	You find a cabin that you can use as shelter until they arrive.<br>
	A few hours after sunset you hear multiple engines…<br>
	You had noticed on your flights approach that the main base on the mountains was huge…<br>
	that's why you called back up, but you hadn’t seen anything to be suspicious of in the town…<br>
	The presence of multiple large vehicles is unsettling.
