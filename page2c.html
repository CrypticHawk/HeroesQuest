	<p> You climb down the fire escape, being careful to keep as quiet as you can.<br>
	You test the handle to check if it was a self locking door and discover it had not locked behind them, <br>
	Carefully you open the door & sneak in, being careful to not make much noise. <br>
	You discover them all gathered in a room discussing their plans.<br>
	You can’t hear them as well as you would like… There is a balcony above… <br>
	Maybe up there would provide a better vantage point?
