	<p>You decide to go Siberia & try this alone, nothing could possibly go wrong.<br>
	You know what you’re doing so… this is fine.<br>
	You stake out the base noticing the routines of the soldiers patrolling the base…<br>#
	They switch out every 3 hours. Where they seem to go on a 30 minute break and then move to another place to patrol…<br>
	They are wearing white & grey camouflage snowsuit. You notice there is one particular guard who has terrible situational awareness…<br>
	You reckon you can knock him out and pose as him to get into the base.
